USOV is a JavaScript universal single object validator. It provides half-safe validation and transformation utilities. Each validator is represented by separated module (no carrying as in another validation libraries), thats gives opportunity for treeshaking. Library has 5 types of modules: validators (only validates entity), processors (only transforms entity), groupers (groups another validators in specific way), spreaders (provides crossvalidation between distanted fields amd recursion), containers (provides additional input/output processing).
